## **Day 2**

## Dependencies refer to external libraries, modules, or packages that a particular piece of software relies on to function correctly. These dependencies are components or functionalities that the software does not implement itself but instead leverages from external sources.

## npm is used for installing, managing, and updating JavaScript packages (libraries, frameworks, and tools) that are used in a project. Developers can easily specify project dependencies in a package.json file, and npm takes care of downloading and installing the correct versions.
